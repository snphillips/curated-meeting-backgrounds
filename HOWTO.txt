How to add more curated sets:

1) create a json in /src/CuratedSets, copying the format of the others
2) create a folder in /public/meeting-backgrounds/curatedSets/ with the name of the curated set in camel case
3) add that folder name to .surgeignore
4) import new curated set name at top of App.js
5) add new curated set name to curatedSets state array in App.js
--You should now see your curated set showing up in the curated set section--
6) Once you've downloaded images to the folder, you should see them on the site
7) Make a zip folder of the new set

How to update NPM packages:

You have lots of dependecies, so this will come in handy:

Ask npm to list which packages have newer versions available using npm outdated:

$ npm outdated

Ask npm to list which GLOBAL packages have newer versions available using npm outdated:

$ npm outdated -g


Then you ask npm to install the latest version of a package. You can ask for the latest version with the @latest tag. You should also use the --save flag to update package.json.

$ npm install lodash@latest --save


If you want to update all global packages

$ npm update -g

If you want to update specific global package

$ npm update -g <package_name>
